#3: Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

#4: Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

##Dataset description:
#The dataset contains 1,384,617 observations of 15 variables, where each row in the dataset is a product from an order. There is a single order per user in this dataset, which means that every single row is an item purchased at one point by the user at a given time. This dataset contains variables describing the time of day of item purchase( "order_hour_of_the_day"), the online order identifier for the user ("order_id"), whether this user had purchased the item at a previous time ("reordered"), etc. Illustrative example:For instance unser number 34, purchased organic whole milk, bananas, marinara pasta sauce, low fat yogurt and half and half. one thing is for sure, they're not allergic to dairy.

#Answers:
#1: There are 134 aisles in this dataset*
#2: Most products are purchased from the fresh fruit aisle and the packaged vegetable fruits aisle*
#3: see plot above*
#4: See table above*

#Description
## This dataset contains 35 observations with 1444 variables. This data represents almost four years of the patient's daily activity, down to each minute of a 24 hour day for 35 days.
## stratifying by day of the week shows that weekends are generaly lower in terms of activity for the patient.
## from the graph we can see that this patient is most active during weekdays; the data also shows that as expected there is minimal activity duing early hours of the day, presumably this is when the patient is sleeping or resting.
